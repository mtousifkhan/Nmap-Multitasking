# Nmap-Multitasking
I have made this tool for performing different scan of Nmap.
It will only ask from you to put ip adress and than ask from you to which type of scan do you want to perform.
I made it to make use of nmap easy.
By use of this tool you have no need to remember the long command of nmap.
Thats All...
          Thank You So Much.
